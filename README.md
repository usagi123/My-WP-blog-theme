# usablog
Wordpress theme for my personal blog. Currently running at https://maiphamquanghuy.com/blog/. 

Successor of [Nishiro fansub theme](https://github.com/usagi123/Nishiro-fansubs-theme)

Build from ground up so probably missing lots of standard features. Will add when needed.

Gallery template use in conjunction with Jetpack plugin and Gutenberg editor gallery feature. 

Emote size is `width: 50px` and `height: 100%`. Add `<img>` tag where you want to add emote in combination with `class="emote"`
