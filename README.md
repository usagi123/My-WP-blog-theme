Wordpress theme for my personal blog. Currently running at https://maiphamquanghuy.com/blog/

Build from stratch so probably missing lots of standard features. Will add when needed.

Gallery template use in conjunction with Jetpack and Gutenberg editor gallery feature. 

Emote size is `width: 50px` and `height: 100%`. Add `<img>` tag where you want to add emote in combination with `class="emote"`
